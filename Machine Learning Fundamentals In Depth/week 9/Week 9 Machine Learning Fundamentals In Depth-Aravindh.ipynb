    "In information technology (IT), an artificial neural network (ANN) is a system of hardware and/or software patterned after the operation of neurons in the human brain. ANNs -- also called, simply, neural networks -- are a variety of deep learning technology, which also falls under the umbrella of artificial intelligence, or AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commercial applications of these technologies generally focus on solving complex signal processing or pattern recognition problems. Examples of significant commercial applications since 2000 include handwriting recognition for check processing, speech-to-text transcription, oil-exploration data analysis, weather prediction and facial recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The history of artificial neural networks goes back to the early days of computing. In 1943, mathematicians Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts built a circuitry system intended to approximate the functioning of the human brain that ran simple algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "It wasnt until around 2010 that research picked up again. The big data trend, where companies amass vast troves of data, and parallel computing gave data scientists the training data and computing resources needed to run complex artificial neural networks. In 2012, a neural network was able to beat human performance at an image recognition task as part of the ImageNet competition. Since then, interest in artificial neural networks as has soared and the technology continues to improve.\n",

    "Neural networks have several use cases across many industries, such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Medical diagnosis by medical image classification\n",
    "Targeted marketing by social network filtering and behavioral data analysis\n",
    "Financial predictions by processing historical data of financial instruments\n",

    "Computer vision\n",
    "Computer vision is the ability of computers to extract information and insights from images and videos. With neural networks, computers can distinguish and recognize images similar to humans. Computer vision has several applications, such as the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual recognition in self-driving cars so they can recognize road signs and other road users\n",
    "Content moderation to automatically remove unsafe or inappropriate content from image and video archives\n",
    "Facial recognition to identify faces and recognize attributes like open eyes, glasses, and facial hair\n",
    "Image labeling to identify brand logos, clothing, safety gear, and other image details\n",
    "Speech recognition\n",
    "Neural networks can analyze human speech despite varying speech patterns, pitch, tone, language, and accent. Virtual assistants like Amazon Alexa and automatic transcription software use speech recognition to do tasks like these:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assist call center agents and automatically classify calls\n",
    "Convert clinical conversations into documentation in real time\n",
    "Accurately subtitle videos and meeting recordings for wider content reach\n",
    "Natural language processing\n",
    "Natural language processing (NLP) is the ability to process natural, human-created text. Neural networks help computers gather insights and meaning from text data and documents. NLP has several use cases, including in these functions:\n",

    "Automatic organization and classification of written data\n",
    "Business intelligence analysis of long-form documents like emails and forms\n",

    "Document summarization and article generation for a given topic\n",
    "Recommendation engines\n",
    "Neural networks can track user activity to develop personalized recommendations. They can also analyze all user behavior and discover new products or services that interest a specific user. For example, Curalate, a Philadelphia-based startup, helps brands convert social media posts into sales. Brands use Curalate’s intelligent product tagging (IPT) service to automate the collection and curation of user-generated social content. IPT uses neural networks to automatically find and recommend products relevant to the user’s social media activity. Consumers don't have to hunt through online catalogs to find a specific product from a social media image. Instead, they can use Curalate’s auto product tagging to purchase the product with ease.\n",

    "Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans: learn by example. Deep learning is a key technology behind driverless cars, enabling them to recognize a stop sign, or to distinguish a pedestrian from a lamppost. It is the key to voice control in consumer devices like phones, tablets, TVs, and hands-free speakers. Deep learning is getting lots of attention lately and for good reason. It’s achieving results that were not possible before.\n",

    "In deep learning, a computer model learns to perform classification tasks directly from images, text, or sound. Deep learning models can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy, sometimes exceeding human-level performance. Models are trained by using a large set of labeled data and neural network architectures that contain many layers.\n",
